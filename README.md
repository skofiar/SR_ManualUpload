# SR_ManualUpload
Improvement of the manual upload to SPIRE - We want to show how it should look like using Shiny

The goal of this will be to show on the one hand the conceptual 
workprocess and on the other hand the UI view in some big lines. 
Further, until this is ready, we could also share the Shiny tool with the 
users.
